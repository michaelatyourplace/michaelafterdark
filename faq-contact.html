      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">How far in advance should we book?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          For <strong>peak season</strong> (April-June, September-October) Charleston bachelorette weekends, booking 3-4 weeks in advance is recommended. During summer months (July-August) and off-season (November-March), 2-3 weeks advance notice typically works. Last-minute bookings are sometimes available depending on schedule — contact directly to check availability.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Do you travel to hotels like The Dewberry, Hotel Bennett, or boutique properties?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What time do performances typically happen?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Most bookings occur between <strong>9 PM - 11 PM</strong>, after groups finish dinner at Charleston restaurants but before heading to Upper King Street bars or late-night venues. This timing allows the celebration to enjoy private entertainment at their rental or hotel before continuing to Charleston's nightlife scene. Flexible scheduling available based on your group's specific timeline.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Are you familiar with Charleston's party scene and restaurants?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Absolutely. As a Mount Pleasant-based service operating throughout Charleston County, there's intimate knowledge of Shem Creek restaurants, Upper King nightlife (Republic, Mynt, Prohibition), rooftop bars (The Vendue, Stars, Pavilion Bar), Charleston dining options, and how bachelorette groups typically flow through the city's celebration geography. This local expertise helps coordinate optimal timing around your group's dinner reservations and nightlife plans.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What makes you different from other entertainment services?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <strong>True local presence.</strong> This isn't a traveling service or national directory — it's a Mount Pleasant-based operation with deep Lowcountry roots and comprehensive knowledge of Charleston County geography. Understanding traffic patterns on the Ravenel Bridge, knowing which vacation rental companies operate on which streets, recognizing local landmarks from The Battery to Breach Inlet — this authentic local knowledge ensures reliable service delivery and seamless coordination that outside services can't match.

      <h2>Quick Charleston Area Tips</h2>
      <p><strong>Parking in downtown Charleston:</strong> If your rental is in Upper King, French Quarter, or South of Broad, expect limited street parking. Consider Uber/Lyft for your group's evening plans.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Best bachelorette neighborhoods:</strong> Upper King Street for walkable nightlife access, James Island for pools and space, Isle of Palms for beach vibes and upscale feel, Folly Beach for laid-back coastal party atmosphere.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Timing around Charleston traffic:</strong> Ravenel Bridge evening traffic clears by 7 PM on weekdays. Weekend evenings have minimal delays. Isle of Palms Connector traffic peaks 4-6 PM on summer Fridays but is clear by evening entertainment hours.</p>
