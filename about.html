  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p><strong>Michael After Dark</strong> was built in Mount Pleasant, SC as a supporting digital brand to <a href="https://michaelatyourplace.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael at Your Place</a> — Charleston’s leading private party entertainment experience. Founded by <strong>Michael Charleston</strong>, the brand began as a single performer offering intimate, private celebrations across the Charleston area and quickly evolved into a trusted name synonymous with discretion, style, and authentic Southern charm.</p>

  <p>While Michael at Your Place remains the official entertainment booking site, Michael After Dark was created to strengthen local connections — serving as a verified online identity for Charleston’s private entertainment scene. Our base of operations is in <strong>Mount Pleasant’s Shem Creek district</strong>, a hub known for its lively nightlife, coastal energy, and the creative spirit that fuels Charleston’s after-dark scene.</p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>Our mission is simple: to preserve authentic, locally owned entertainment for Charleston’s most unforgettable nights. Whether it’s a bachelorette weekend, private birthday, or beach house celebration, every booking supports local talent and keeps the spirit of Charleston nightlife personal, private, and rooted in community trust.</p>

  <p>Unlike national entertainment franchises that operate behind fake profiles and call centers, Michael After Dark and <a href="https://michaelatyourplace.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael at Your Place</a> are fully transparent — locally managed, verified, and accessible to Charleston’s real event planners, hosts, and party groups.</p>

  <h2>Our Connection to Charleston</h2>
  <p>We proudly serve clients across the <strong>Charleston metro area</strong>, from <a href="https://www.charlestoncvb.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Downtown Charleston</a> and <strong>King Street</strong> to <strong>Folly Beach</strong> and <strong>Isle of Palms</strong>. Every event reflects the city’s blend of history and nightlife — from luxury Airbnbs to waterfront villas overlooking the harbor. Charleston isn’t just our service area; it’s part of our brand identity.</p>

  <p>Our roots in <strong>Mount Pleasant</strong> give us a home base where local hospitality meets creative energy. The neighborhood’s proximity to Charleston bridges our network of event planners, vendors, and trusted partners who all contribute to making every party a polished experience.</p>
