    <h1>Chucktown Bachelorette Party Checklist</h1>
    <p style="font-size:1.2rem;color:#ccc;">Your complete timeline for planning the perfect Chucktown celebration</p>
    <p class="author-note">Last updated: January 2025 | Based on years of Chucktown bachelorette party experience</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <div class="intro-box">
      <p>
        Chucktown has become one of the Southeast's top bachelorette destinations, and for good reason. Historic downtown charm, world-class restaurants, beautiful beaches just minutes away, and a nightlife scene that balances sophistication with Southern fun — it's the perfect backdrop for celebrating your bride-to-be.
      </p>
      <p>
        But planning a Chucktown bachelorette party requires more than just booking flights. Between choosing the right neighborhood for your vacation rental, timing your arrival around peak season pricing, coordinating transportation across the Ravenel Bridge, and scheduling everything from rooftop bar reservations to private entertainment, there's a lot to manage.
      </p>
      <p>
        This checklist breaks down exactly what to do and when, based on real Chucktown experience. Whether you're renting a beach house on Isle of Palms, a historic property in the French Quarter, or a modern loft in Upper King Street, this guide will keep you organized.

    <h2>3-4 Months Before: Foundation Planning</h2>

    <div class="timeline-section">
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>✓ Set Your Budget</h3>
        <p>
          Chucktown bachelorette parties typically run $600-1,200 per person for a weekend (Friday-Sunday), depending on accommodation choices and activity level. Break down costs:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Vacation rental:</strong> $200-400/person for 2 nights (varies dramatically by location and season)</li>
          <li><strong>Flights:</strong> Chucktown International Airport (CHS) — price varies by origin city</li>
          <li><strong>Food & drinks:</strong> $150-300/person for weekend dining and bars</li>
          <li><strong>Activities:</strong> $100-200/person (boat charters, entertainment, experiences)</li>
          <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> $50-100/person (Uber/Lyft, possible party bus)</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="pro-tip">
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> April-May and September-October are peak season with higher rental prices but best weather. July-August offers lower rental rates but intense heat and humidity. November-March provides the best deals with mild winter weather.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>✓ Choose Your Dates</h3>
        <p>
          Weekend vs. extended weekend matters in Chucktown. Consider:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Friday-Sunday:</strong> Standard bachelorette weekend, arrive Friday afternoon/evening, depart Sunday</li>
          <li><strong>Thursday-Sunday:</strong> Extended weekend allows for beach day Thursday, full party schedule Friday-Saturday, recovery Sunday</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid:</strong> Major Chucktown events unless that's your goal (Spoleto Festival late May-early June, Chucktown Wine + Food Festival in March, Southeastern Wildlife Exposition in February create higher prices and crowds)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>✓ Select Your Neighborhood</h3>
        <p>
          Location strategy is critical in Chucktown. Each area offers different advantages:
        </p>
        
        <div class="checklist-box">
          <div class="checklist-item">
            <strong>Upper King Street (Downtown Chucktown)</strong><br>
            <span style="color:#ccc;">Best for: Walkable nightlife, hotel options, restaurant access</span><br>
            Walk to bars, King Street shopping, rooftop venues. Limited parking. Hotels like The Dewberry, Hotel Bennett, The Francis. Expect $300-500/night for hotel suites or $3,000-5,000 for weekend vacation rental.
          </div>
          
          <div class="checklist-item">
            <strong>French Quarter (Downtown Chucktown)</strong><br>
            <span style="color:#ccc;">Best for: Historic charm, elegant properties, Southern aesthetic</span><br>
            Cobblestone streets, historic homes, proximity to waterfront dining. More expensive, less party-focused than Upper King. Ideal for sophisticated celebrations prioritizing Chucktown's historic character.
          </div>
          
          <div class="checklist-item">
            <strong>Isle of Palms</strong><br>
            <span style="color:#ccc;">Best for: Beach vibes, upscale feel, pool properties</span><br>
            20 minutes from downtown via Isle of Palms Connector. Wild Dunes Resort area, oceanfront rentals, family-friendly beaches. Large rental properties with pools. Must Uber to Chucktown nightlife. Expect $4,000-8,000 for weekend beachfront rental.
          </div>
          
          <div class="checklist-item">
            <strong>Folly Beach</strong><br>
            <span style="color:#ccc;">Best for: Laid-back atmosphere, surf culture, budget-friendly</span><br>
            30 minutes from downtown Chucktown. Bohemian beach town with local bars (The Washout, Taco Boy). More affordable than Isle of Palms. Popular with younger bachelorette groups. Less refined than IOP but more authentic beach town energy.
          </div>
          
          <div class="checklist-item">
            <strong>James Island</strong><br>
            <span style="color:#ccc;">Best for: Space, pools, budget balance</span><br>
            Between Chucktown and Folly Beach. Larger properties with pools and yards. 15-20 minutes to downtown via James Island Connector. Best value for groups wanting space without beach premium pricing.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="pro-tip">
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Groups prioritizing nightlife should stay downtown (Upper King area). Groups prioritizing daytime beach activities and private space should choose Isle of Palms or Folly Beach. James Island offers the best compromise if you want both worlds without breaking the budget.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>✓ Book Your Vacation Rental or Hotel</h3>
        <p>
          Peak season properties book 3-4 months ahead minimum. Search Airbnb, VRBO, or local property management companies. Key factors:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bedrooms:</strong> Plan for 2 people per bedroom (groups of 8-10 need 4-5 bedrooms)</li>
          <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Critical for downtown Chucktown — confirm off-street parking availability</li>
          <li><strong>Pool:</strong> Valuable for daytime hangout between activities (especially summer)</li>
          <li><strong>Kitchen:</strong> Saves money on breakfast, pre-game supplies, late-night snacks</li>
          <li><strong>Outdoor space:</strong> Rooftop deck, balcony, or yard for group gatherings</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="pro-tip">
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Read reviews specifically mentioning bachelorette parties. Some properties/neighborhoods have strict noise policies. Downtown Chucktown's South of Broad and Harleston Village are beautiful but very residential with active noise enforcement. Upper King and James Island are more party-tolerant.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>✓ Send Save-the-Dates to Your Group</h3>
        <p>
          Once dates and location are confirmed, notify your group immediately so they can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Book flights to Chucktown International Airport (CHS)</li>
          <li>Request time off work</li>
          <li>Budget for the trip</li>
          <li>Arrange childcare if needed</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>2 Months Before: Activity Planning</h2>

    <div class="timeline-section">
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>✓ Research and Book Major Activities</h3>
        <p>
          Popular Chucktown bachelorette activities book up, especially weekends in April-June and September-October. Consider:
        </p>
        
        <div class="checklist-box">
          <div class="checklist-item">
            <strong>Boat Charters</strong><br>
            Chucktown Harbor cruises, sandbar trips, sunset cruises. Book through Chucktown Harbor Tours, private yacht charters from Chucktown Maritime Center. Expect $500-1,500 for private 2-3 hour charter depending on boat size.
          </div>
          
          <div class="checklist-item">
            <strong>Private Entertainment</strong><br>
            Male entertainment for your rental property. Peak season requires 3-4 weeks advance booking minimum. Services based in Mount Pleasant (like <a href="https://michaelafterdark.com" target="_blank">Michael After Dark</a>) provide reliable local service across Chucktown, Isle of Palms, Folly Beach, and surrounding areas.
          </div>
          
          <div class="checklist-item">
            <strong>Group Activities</strong><br>
            Options include: Chucktown culinary tours, historic district walking tours, beach day at Isle of Palms County Park or Folly Beach, golf at Wild Dunes, spa services (mobile glam squads will come to your rental).
          </div>
          
          <div class="checklist-item">
            <strong>Party Bus or Transportation</strong><br>
            If you're staying at the beach and want a downtown Chucktown night without Uber logistics, book a party bus. Chucktown Party Ride and similar services offer packages. Alternatively, plan on heavy Uber/Lyft usage.
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>✓ Make Restaurant Reservations</h3>
        <p>
          Chucktown's top restaurants require reservations, especially for groups of 8+. Popular bachelorette dinner spots:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Upscale Southern:</strong> Husk (76 Queen Street), FIG (232 Meeting Street), The Ordinary (544 King Street for seafood), Hall's Chophouse (434 King Street)</li>
          <li><strong>Group-friendly:</strong> Leon's Oyster Shop (698 King Street), Taco Boy (multiple locations), The Rooftop at The Vendue (waterfront views), Shem Creek restaurants in Mount Pleasant (Vickery's, Red's Ice House, Water's Edge)</li>
          <li><strong>Brunch (Sunday):</strong> Hominy Grill, Poogan's Porch, Magnolias</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="pro-tip">
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> For large groups (10+), consider restaurants with private dining rooms or make multiple reservations at same time (split into groups of 6). Shem Creek in Mount Pleasant offers less crowded, more relaxed dining than downtown Chucktown and is perfect for sunset views before heading out.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>✓ Plan Your Nightlife Strategy</h3>
        <p>
          Chucktown nightlife concentrates in specific zones. Typical bachelorette party flow:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>7-9 PM:</strong> Dinner at chosen restaurant</li>
          <li><strong>9-10 PM:</strong> Return to rental for private entertainment, outfit changes, pre-game</li>
          <li><strong>10:30 PM-2 AM:</strong> Head out to bars/clubs</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Upper King Street Nightlife:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Republic Garden & Lounge — upscale club atmosphere, popular with bachelorette groups</li>
          <li>Mynt — nightclub with DJs, bottle service available</li>
          <li>Prohibition — speakeasy-style cocktail bar</li>
          <li>The Commodore — late-night bar with dancing</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Rooftop Bars (Start Earlier, 5-8 PM):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Rooftop at The Vendue — harbor views, Ravenel Bridge backdrop</li>
          <li>Stars Rooftop & Grill Room — Upper King location</li>
          <li>Pavilion Bar — Market Street area</li>
          <li>Élevé at Grand Bohemian Hotel — 360-degree Chucktown views</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>3-4 Weeks Before: Final Details</h2>

    <div class="timeline-section">
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>✓ Confirm Entertainment Bookings</h3>
        <p>
          If booking private entertainment for your rental, confirm details:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Exact address and property location (especially important for beach properties — provide specific street address, not just "Isle of Palms")</li>
          <li>Arrival time (typically 9-10 PM after dinner, before late-night bars)</li>
          <li>Parking situation (critical for downtown Chucktown properties)</li>
          <li>Special requests or themes</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="pro-tip">
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Local Mount Pleasant-based services understand Chucktown geography intimately — they know Ravenel Bridge traffic patterns, can navigate to Isle of Palms properties via the IOP Connector efficiently, and arrive reliably. This local knowledge matters when coordinating timing with your group's dinner reservations and nightlife plans.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>✓ Create Detailed Itinerary</h3>
        <p>
          Share a Google Doc or planning app with your group including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Friday arrival times and airport pickup logistics</li>
          <li>Saturday schedule with specific times and addresses</li>
          <li>Restaurant reservations (name, address, time, confirmation number)</li>
          <li>Activity bookings with meeting locations</li>
          <li>Sunday departure schedule</li>
          <li>Emergency contacts</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>✓ Plan Decorations and Supplies</h3>
        <p>
          If decorating your rental:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bachelorette party decorations (banners, sashes, etc.) — ship to rental property in advance if possible</li>
          <li>Party supplies (cups, paper goods, snacks)</li>
          <li>Pool floats if your property has a pool</li>
          <li>Matching outfits or accessories for group photos</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          Consider stopping at Target (Mount Pleasant location at 1625 N Highway 17) or Walmart on arrival day rather than flying with bulky items.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>✓ Coordinate Transportation</h3>
        <p>
          Finalize how your group will move around Chucktown:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Airport to rental:</strong> Uber/Lyft from CHS airport takes 20-40 minutes depending on rental location (downtown Chucktown 20-25 min, Isle of Palms 30-35 min, Folly Beach 35-40 min)</li>
          <li><strong>Daily transportation:</strong> Downtown groups can walk most places; beach groups need ride-share budget</li>
          <li><strong>Party bus:</strong> If booked, confirm pickup times and locations</li>
          <li><strong>Designated drivers:</strong> Not recommended — Chucktown's nightlife and Ravenel Bridge crossing make Uber/Lyft safer and easier</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>1 Week Before: Final Preparations</h2>

    <div class="timeline-section">
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>✓ Confirm All Reservations</h3>
        <p>
          Call or email to confirm:

        <ul>
          <li>Vacation rental check-in time and procedures</li>
          <li>Restaurant reservations (mention it's a bachelorette party — some restaurants will add special touches)</li>
          <li>Activity bookings and meeting locations</li>
          <li>Entertainment arrival time and contact info</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>✓ Check Chucktown Weather</h3>
        <p>
          Chucktown weather impacts plans significantly:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Summer (June-August):</strong> 90-95°F with high humidity — plan indoor activities during peak heat, focus on pools and air-conditioned venues</li>
          <li><strong>Spring/Fall (April-May, Sept-Oct):</strong> 70-80°F perfect weather — ideal for rooftop bars and outdoor activities</li>
          <li><strong>Winter (Dec-Feb):</strong> 55-65°F — pack layers, some outdoor activities still viable</li>
          <li><strong>Rain:</strong> Summer afternoon thunderstorms common — have backup indoor plans</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>✓ Create Packing List</h3>
        <p>
          Chucktown-specific packing considerations:

          <li>Point person for rental property (check-in, issues, checkout)</li>
          <li>Transportation coordinator (Uber accounts, party bus communication)</li>
          <li>Restaurant liaison (handles group dinner logistics)</li>
          <li>Activity coordinator (confirms bookings, gets group to right place on time)</li>

    <h2>Day-Of: Chucktown Weekend Flow</h2>

    <div class="timeline-section">
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>Friday Arrival</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Afternoon:</strong> Flights arrive at CHS, group meets at rental, settle in, unpack</li>
          <li><strong>Evening:</strong> Casual welcome dinner (Shem Creek restaurants in Mount Pleasant, Taco Boy, or something near your rental)</li>
          <li><strong>Night:</strong> Low-key first night — explore neighborhood, maybe hit one or two bars, early-ish bedtime to prepare for Saturday</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>Saturday (Main Event Day)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Morning:</strong> Sleep in, leisurely breakfast at rental or brunch out</li>
          <li><strong>Midday:</strong> Pool time or boat charter or beach day depending on weather and bookings</li>
          <li><strong>Late Afternoon:</strong> Return to rental, shower and get ready for evening</li>
          <li><strong>Early Evening (5-7 PM):</strong> Pre-dinner rooftop bar for sunset and photos</li>
          <li><strong>Dinner (7-9 PM):</strong> Main group dinner at reserved restaurant</li>
          <li><strong>Return to Rental (9-10 PM):</strong> Private entertainment, outfit changes, pre-game drinks</li>
          <li><strong>Late Night (11 PM-2 AM):</strong> Upper King Street bars and clubs</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="pro-tip">
          <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Saturday evening is when everything comes together. The 9-10 PM window back at your rental between dinner and nightlife is the ideal time for private entertainment — your group is energized from dinner, dressed up, ready to celebrate, but not yet exhausted from a full night out. This timing lets you enjoy exclusive entertainment in your private space before heading to Chucktown's bar scene.

    <h2>Chucktown Bachelorette Party Pro Tips</h2>

    <div class="checklist-box">
      <div class="checklist-item">
        <strong>Download Uber/Lyft before arrival</strong> — Cell service at Chucktown airport can be spotty, get apps set up in advance
      </div>
      
      <div class="checklist-item">
        <strong>Respect residential neighborhoods</strong> — Chucktown takes noise ordinances seriously, especially South of Broad and historic areas. Keep outdoor noise reasonable, especially after 10 PM.
      </div>
      
      <div class="checklist-item">
        <strong>Ravenel Bridge traffic</strong> — If staying in Mount Pleasant or beach communities and going downtown, avoid Friday evening rush hour (4:30-6:30 PM). Bridge is clear by 7 PM.
      </div>
      
      <div class="checklist-item">
        <strong>Upper King Street weekends</strong> — This nightlife corridor gets crowded 11 PM-2 AM on Fridays and Saturdays. Expect lines at popular clubs, surge pricing for Ubers leaving the area.
      </div>
      
      <div class="checklist-item">
        <strong>Stay hydrated</strong> — Chucktown's heat and humidity are no joke, especially if you're from cooler climates. Drink water between alcoholic beverages, especially during daytime activities.
      </div>
      
      <div class="checklist-item">
        <strong>Cash for tips</strong> — While most Chucktown venues accept cards, having cash for tipping Uber drivers, bartenders, and service providers makes everything smoother.
      </div>
      
      <div class="checklist-item">
        <strong>Book local, arrive reliably</strong> — When choosing service providers (entertainment, activities, transportation), prioritize local Chucktown County businesses. Mount Pleasant-based services understand the geography, arrive on time, and know how to navigate Ravenel Bridge traffic, IOP Connector routes, and downtown Chucktown logistics that out-of-town providers struggle with.
      </div>
      
      <div class="checklist-item">
        <strong>Photo opportunities</strong> — Don't miss: Rainbow Row (colorful historic houses), The Battery waterfront, Pineapple Fountain at Waterfront Park, Ravenel Bridge from Mount Pleasant's Pitt Street Bridge, any Chucktown rooftop at sunset

    <h2>Common Chucktown Bachelorette Party Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

    <div class="pro-tip">
      <strong>Mistake #1: Underestimating travel times</strong><br>
      Chucktown sprawls more than people expect. Downtown to Folly Beach is 30+ minutes. Isle of Palms to downtown is 20+ minutes. James Island to anywhere is 20-25 minutes. Factor in travel time when planning your schedule, and don't book activities back-to-back without buffer time.
    </div>

    <div class="pro-tip">
      <strong>Mistake #2: Over-scheduling Saturday</strong><br>
      Groups often try to fit too much into one day. Choose 1-2 main activities (boat charter OR beach day, not both), plus dinner and nightlife. Leave space for spontaneity and group bonding time at your rental.
    </div>

    <div class="pro-tip">
      <strong>Mistake #3: Ignoring parking logistics downtown</strong><br>
      If you rent cars or plan to drive, downtown Chucktown parking is expensive and scarce. Upper King Street has some street parking but it's metered and time-limited. Budget for parking garages ($20-30/day) or just Uber everywhere.
